## Contributing
To find a way to contribute, visit the project tied to this repo. Your guideline to understanding the project will be under the 'Project' heading down below!

We are discussing ideal methods to contribute. We will either be adding users as collaborators, or using the fork method. This will be updated once we come to a conclusion. At the moment though, message either iMrBranflake or Nobody within the server to recieve an invite to the repo. The invite will go through your email address associated with your Github account.

### Project
  The project hosts 3 columns:
   * Needs Learner - Any items under this section are up for grabs. These will include features to be added in, bug fixes, etc.
      * To claim something from this section, please navigate to the Issues tab in the repo. Once there find the item you wanted to work on and post a comment that you'd like to work on it. A repo maintainer will then move that item to the in progress section with your name included.

   * In Progress - Any items here are currently in progress. The name of the user working on the feature, bug, etc will be included.

   * Completed - Completed items will go here with the name of the user!

# Closer
  All help is greatly appreciated and we really hope everybody can learn atleast something from this project. The goal is to allow all interested users to contribute in one way or another. The repo will not be dominated by only a couple contributors while others watch wishing they got a chance as well. We're all here to learn and work together!
